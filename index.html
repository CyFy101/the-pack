  <h1>The Pack</h1>
  <img src="images/all-dogs.jpg" class="header-image" alt="A Pic of Cyan and The Whole Pack, sitting on her couch">
  <ul>
    <img src="images/brownie.jpg" alt="A Picture of Brownie Smiling">
    <li><span class="dog-names">Brownie</span>:
      <ul>
        <li>The oldest of the group and the first ever to start the pack we have today.</li>
        <li>Brownie was adopted from a walmart parking lot when Cyan was only 17 years old.</li>
        <li>It was the first dog, cyan had ever had without her parents assistance.</li>
        <li>Admittedly, Brownie wasn't the prettiest but for $30 bucks Cyan wasn't complaining.</li>
        <li>After some TLC, Brownie eventually put on weight and became Cyan's number 1.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <img src="images/butterz.jpg" alt="A Picture of Butterz wrapped in a blankie">
    <li><span class="dog-names">Butterz</span>:
      <ul>
        <li>He's the middle aged one of the pack, and was made when brownie got a Chihuahua pregnant.</li>
        <li>Butterz was the biggest of the litter and was originally going to be named "Big Booty". </li>
        <li>However, due to conflicting interestes of an ex lover - Cyan came up with Butterz after watching South Park.
        </li>
        <li>He's quite possibly the most annoying one of the group, but his buttery eyes help him to get away with his
          mischevious nature.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <img src="images/biscuit.jpg" alt="A Picture of Biscuit resting his head on Cyan's knee while sleeping">
    <li><span class="dog-names">Biscuit</span>:
      <ul>
        <li>He's the second oldest and wasn't always the sweet floofer we all know him to be today.</li>
        <li>We're not sure what life was like for Biscuit prior to being found.</li>
        <li>Cyan acquired him through the Azle Animal shelter that she volunteers at.</li>
        <li>Through some TLC, Biscuit was able to learn how to be a dog.</li>
        <li>And Cyan fell in love with his sweet disposition.</li>
        <li>He's probably the most opionated one of the group, but his sweet little Bambi eyes help him out of the
          trouble he causes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <img src="images/bopo-head.jpg"
      alt="A Picture of BoPo Head resting her head on Chyan's thigh while taking a snooze">
    <li><span class="dog-names">BoPo Head</span>:
      <ul>
        <li>She's the youngest of the pack but certainly the biggest. </li>
        <li>This sweet Plott Hound was abandoned on Cyan's old highschool teacher's property.</li>
        <li>Originally, Cyan wasn't going to take the puppy. She just wanted to meet her.</li>
        <li>However, the Animal Shelter that Cyan volunteers at, Pets Fur People, refused to take the puppy in due to an
          intestinal parasite called Coccidia.</li>
        <li>With the options being animal control or an emergency Foster - the prospects were looking pretty grim for
          the puppy.</li>
        <li>Cyan decided to bring the puppy home for fostering.</li>
        <li>Over time, Cyan of course fell for the sweet girl and adopted her.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
