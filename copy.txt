Dogs are great! If you don't have a dog you're not living. Get a dog!
Reasons to get a dog: they're fluffy, floofy, scruffy, scroofy - bloated and gassy - but happy and waggy. 

* Brownie: The oldest of the group and the first ever to start the pack we have today.
    - Brownie was adopted from a walmart parking lot when Cyan was only 17 years old. 
    - It was the first dog, cyan had ever had without her parents assistance. 
    - Admittedly, Brownie wasn't the prettiest but for $30 bucks Cyan wasn't complaining. 
    - After some TLC, Brownie eventually put on weight and became Cyan's number 1. 

* Butterz: He's the middle aged one of the pack, and was made when brownie got a Chihuahua pregnant. 
    - Butterz was the biggest of the litter and was originally going to be named "Big Booty". 
    - However, due to conflicting interestes of an ex lover - Cyan came up with Butterz after watching South Park. 
    - HE's quite possibly the most annoying one of the group, but his buttery eyes help him to get away with his mischevious nature. 

* Biscuit: He's the second oldest and wasn't always the sweet floofer we all know him to be today.
    - We're not sure what life was like for Biscuit prior to being found.
    - Cyan acquired him through the Azle Animal shelter that she volunteers at. 
    - Through some TLC, Biscuit was able to learn how to be a dog. 
    - And Cyan fell in love with his sweet disposition.
    - He's probably the most opionated one of the group, but his sweet little Bambi eyes help him out of the trouble he causes. 

* BoPo Head: She's the youngest of the pack but certainly the biggest. 
    - This sweet Plott Hound was abandoned on Cyan's old highschool teacher's property. 
    - Originally, Cyan wasn't going to take the puppy. She just wanted to meet her. 
    - However, the Animal Shelter that Cyan volunteers at, Pets Fur People, refused to take the puppy in due to an intestinal parasite called Coccidia.
    - With the options being animal control or an emergency Foster - the prospects were looking pretty grim for the puppy. 
    - Cyan decided to bring the puppy home for fostering. 
    - Over time, Cyan of course fell for the sweet girl and adopted her.
